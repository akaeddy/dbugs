# Missing Line
Cean is solving a very challenging Kattis problem. And the input format is really weird!
His program won't read in all the lines as he expects. Hmmmmmm.
* This first line is the number of test cases, `T`.
* Each test case starts with an positive integer `N`, and followed by `N` lines.
Help Cean print all the lines correctly.
### Sample Input
```
2
3
test case 1. first line
test case 1. second line
test case 1. third line
2
test case 2. first line
test case 2. second line
```
### Expected Output
```
test case 1. first line
test case 1. second line
test case 1. third line
test case 2. first line
test case 2. second line
```
