# Catan
Emma loves playing board games with her friends, and `catan` is her favorite board game. 
Whenever she plays board game, she wants to check if the `catan` is an option.
One of her friends write some code to help her, but the code has some small issues.
Here is what the code does:
* Return the index where `catan` first occurred.
* Return `-1` if it doesn't exist (which is very sad).
### Sample Input 1
```

```
### Expected Output 1
```
42
```
### Sample Input 2
```
a, b, c, d, e
```
### Expected Output 2

```
